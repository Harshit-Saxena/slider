# slider
A slider for images in 2 diff ways

Carousel created with JS.. it has 2 options either that when at end it circles back to start or the btn prev is hidden at start and btn next is hidden at end....rn the 2nd option is in place...just un-comment the working in slides and comment the buttons section in JS

If using option 2 then the prevBtn.style.display = "none" needs to be outside the function carousel for the button to be hidden right from the start and not after the user click on button
